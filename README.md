# FetchAPI

An attempt at implementing the JavaScript fetch() function in Python. Uses [PromiseAPI](https://github.com/User0332/promiseapi) for the returned `Promise`. Is still a work in progress and currently returns a Promise resolving to a `httpx.Response` object, unlike what the actual `fetch()` function would return.
